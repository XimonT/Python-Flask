## Create a Virtual Enviroment

Virtual environments enable you to have an isolated space on your server for Python projects. We’ll use venv, part of the standard Python 3 library, which we can install by typing:

`sudo apt install -y python3-venv`

Here, we’ll call our new environment "my_env"

`python3 -m venv my_env`

Activate the environment using the command below

`source my_env/bin/activate`

Deactivate the environment using the command below

`deactivate`
